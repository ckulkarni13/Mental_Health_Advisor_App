# Mental Health Advisor Application ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡

## Overview
The **Mental Health Advisor Application** is designed to empower mental health professionals with intelligent, personalized, and actionable suggestions for supporting their patients. Combining **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, the application delivers context-aware, insightful responses tailored to patient needs. 

The application leverages **Pinecone** for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring fast and accurate recommendations, alongside a user-friendly interface built with **Streamlit**.

## Features
- **ðŸŒŸ Smart Suggestions**: Generates tailored advice using RAG based on patient needs and queries.
- **âš¡ Fast Retrieval**: Quickly fetches relevant information from the Pinecone vector database.
- **ðŸ§  AI-Powered Insights**: Uses cutting-edge LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to provide empathetic and meaningful guidance.
- **ðŸ’» User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for mental health professionals with a focus on simplicity and efficiency.

## How It Works
1. **Data Input**: Advisors input patient details, select mental health topics, or type specific queries.
